DbChanger
=================
Toolkit for advanced database change (dbChange) management.

* Deploy and install centrally
* Multiple environments with multiple schemas & users
* Each dbChange can have multiple sql files with arbitrary placeholders
* Simple environment configuration
* Each dbChange can define multiple other dbChanges that are required 

Currently supported databases: 
* `ORACLE` 

Architecture
=================
- [Database schema](misc/erm/datamodel.png)

* `Environment` can have multiple `Users` assigned to multiple `Groups` and also can have multiple `Placeholders` defined  
* `DbChange` consists of fragments.
* `Fragment` is bunch of sql queries defined in one sql file - sql content is more like template
* Each DbChange can be installed on environment, this is represented as Installation. 
* `Installation` can be successful, cancelled, but always one active at the same time
Each installation consists of Installation fragments.
`Installation fragment` is modified sql content of particular fragment, 
crafted for particular environment and user. Its identificator starts by letter F, e.g. `F10`

 
DbChange `12345` has its own [directory](misc/sampledata/12345).
It consists of 10 fragments. Therefore 10 files:
* [01_central.sql](misc/sampledata/12345/01_central.sql)
* [02_central.sql](misc/sampledata/12345/02_central.sql)
* ...
* [10_region.sql](misc/sampledata/12345/10_region.sql)

Each file name follow mask `XXXXXX_YYYYYYY_ZZZZZZZ.sql` where
* `XXXXXX` is optional and can serve as a file prefix, in our example it is completly empty (e.g. dbchange_)
* `YYYYYY` is numeric fragment index, must be numeric and incremental, identified with letter I (e.g. I5)
* `ZZZZZZ` is group name  

File [_requirements.txt](misc/sampledata/12345/_requirements.txt) can contain list of 
required dbChanges that must be installed before this dbChange can be installed.
One dbChange code per line. Empty or missing file means dbChange does not require any dbChange to be installed. 

Each fragment content must be atomic from transactional perspective. 
E.g. Oracle does not support rolling back of DDL statements therefore all these queries must be in its own separate file.

Groups can be defined in `config.local.neon` file for each environment different. E.g.
* `central: [MAINUSER]` - means fragment sql content with group `central` will be executed for MAINUSER
* `region: [SLAVEUSER1, SLAVEUSER2]` means fragment sql content with group `region` will be executed for SLAVEUSER1 and also for user SLAVEUSER2

User can define arbitrary number of groups and assigned arbitrary number of users into each group.

In fragment sql content `placeholders` can be used. Processing engine simple replace placeholder with
defined value in config file which is to be replaced. 

Group name can be also used as a placeholder. As a result,
line of sql code will be inserted for each user assigned into the group and placeholder value will 
be replaced with user name.

Available Installation statuses:
* `N` = `New` - initial status which means installation can start
* `P` = `Pending` - status signaling that at least one pending installation fragment exists 
* `I` = `Installed` - all installation fragments were successfully installed
* `R` = `Rolled back` - all installation fragments were successfully rolled back
* `C` = `Cancelled` - all installation fragments were cancelled

Available Installation fragment statuses:
* `N` = `New` - initial status which means installation fragment is ready for installation
* `P` = `Pending` - status signaling that installation of this installation fragment already started but something wrong happened
* `I` = `Installed` - installation fragment has been successfully installed
* `R` = `Rolled back` - installation fragment has been successfully rolled back
* `C` = `Cancelled` - installation fragment has been cancelled

Installation
---------
1] Install DbChanger with all necessary dependencies with
```
composer require kapcus/dbchanger
```

2] run sql scripts located in [build](build) folder. This will install DbChanger internal database tables.
(you need to be able to create table, trigger, sequence, see [grants.sql](misc/grants.sql))

3] Move [config.local.neon.example](misc/config.local.neon.example) into `dbchanger/config.local.neon` and setup dbchanger.database section (this is where database for central DbChanger logic will be running).

4] run this to verify if DbChanger is properly installed and configured
```
php bin/console.php dbchanger:check
``` 

Usage
---------

1] Define your environments in `dbchanger/config.local.neon`.

========================================

2] Initialize the environment (e.g. DEV) with
``` 
php bin/console.php dbchanger:init DEV
```

This command will load environment data specified in configuration file into internal
DbChanger database. Now, environment is ready for dbChange deployments.

========================================
 
3] Register dbChange (e.g. 12345) with
```
php bin/console.php dbchanger:register 12345

php bin/console.php dbchanger:register 12345 -d
```

This command will load sql content of dbChange files into internal DbChanger database.
Now, dbChange is ready to be installed on selected environment.
In case -d is specified, all dependant DbChanges specified in file `_requirements.txt` are ignored. This is useful during development when
developer needs to test one particular DbChanges and dependencies are not important.

Source dbChange content is searched in `inputDirectory` specified in [config.neon](config/config.neon)

========================================

4] Install dbChange (e.g. 12345) with
```
php bin/console.php dbchanger:install DEV 12345
``` 

This command will establish the connection with environment under specified user.
Once connected, it will execute sql queries for selected dbChange, one by one.
Once each whole dbChange installation fragment is successfully installed, proper
status is set.

All executed queries are logged into `logDirectory` specified in [config.neon](config/config.neon) 

========================================

Other functionality
---------
DbChanger can display status of the installation and if the installation is still in progress,
all installation fragments are listed with particular attributes
(e.g. display status of installation for dbChange 12345 on DEV environment)
```
php bin/console.php dbchanger:status DEV 12345
```

In case installation fails or group is to be installed manually, manual interaction is expected.
During installation, DbChanger will recognize this state and will report it.
Once manually executed or fixed, it is necessary to tell DbChanger that issue
has been fixed. Following command can change status of dbChange fragment 
(e.g. fragment F3 to status INSTALLED) 
```
php bin/console.php dbchanger:mark F3 I
```

========================================

It can be also useful to dump dbChange or individual fragment content into the file.
E.g. in case of manual dbChange when sql can be executed by separate process only.
Following command will generate final sql content for environment DEV, dbChange 12345
and fragment with index 7 whole content. Output folder can be specified in 
configuration file. In case -d is specified, output is dumped into standard output. 
```
php bin/console.php dbchanger:generate DEV 12345

php bin/console.php dbchanger:generate DEV 12345 I7

php bin/console.php dbchanger:generate DEV 12345 I7 -d
```

Source dbChange content is searched in `inputDirectory` specified in [config.neon](config/config.neon)
Generated content is stored in `outputDirectory` specified in [config.neon](config/config.neon)

Special types of sql fragments
---------
* It is possible to specify different delimiter (e.g. in case of Oracle create procedure/trigger),
just add comment `-- DELIMITER`, see [example](misc/sampledata/12346)

* It is possible to multiply only part of sql query when group placeholder is to be replaced.
For this purpose, see `/*START*/`, `/*END*/`, `/*GLUE_START` and `GLUE_END*/` usage in
[example](misc/sampledata/12347)

TODO
---------
* add comments into source code
* Check command - check all connections, check all sequences

* Reinit command - when environment, group, user is changed/added/removed, reflect this change
* Register command - add update support when dbChange/fragment is changed
* Rollback command - add support for inverse dbChange and implement dbChange roll back
* List command - list all dbchange which can be registered
